<p>Thailand is located somewhere in South East Asia, it is a huge natural resources with smile people. They're living very peacefully but that's the past. Today many of them not smile any more. Sadness. :'(</p><p>When you visit Thailand you can go any way by planes, boats, even walking across the river. It has rivers surrounding from north to south. Amazing.</p>
